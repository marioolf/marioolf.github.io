Last week, I took the Certified Red Team Professional course. My goal was to build a strong foundation in Active Directory attack and defense, and honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better course. From the materials to the lab experience, everything exceeded my expectations.

# Course Experience
I started by watching the video tutorials, which explain core Active Directory concepts. These are a must-watch, as they cover everything essential. Taking good notes on these videos can save you a lot of research time later.

Once I had watched all the videos, I focused on finishing my notes. The course also provides access to a Discord server, where people actively ask and answer questions, which is a great bonus for additional support.

# Lab Experience
Next, I moved on to the lab environment, and I have to say it was incredibly engaging. You receive a Lab Manual that guides you through each learning objective step by step, making sure you don’t get stuck when trying things out for the first time. The lab covers everything explained in the videos, providing detailed commands for executing attacks and enumerating every possible aspect of the environment.

# Exam Experience & Tips
After spending some time going through the lab objectives, I took the exam. You get 24 hours for the practical part and plenty of time to write the report (you might even complete half of it during the exam).

Here are some tips for the exam:
✅ Enumerate a lot—really, a lot. Don't worry if you spend several hours just gathering information. Thorough enumeration is key.
✅ Take plenty of screenshots. It’s better to have too many than to finish the exam and realize you didn't capture enough evidence.
✅ Take short breaks and get proper sleep. Fatigue can slow you down, so pace yourself.

# Final Thoughts
Overall, my exam experience was very positive, and I highly recommend AlteredSecurity. I might take other courses from them in the future for sure!
